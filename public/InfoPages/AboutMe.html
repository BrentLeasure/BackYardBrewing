			<p>Hello, my name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brentonleasure" target="_blank">Brent Leasure.</a> Welcome to my website!</p>

			<p>Recently, I graduated from RefactorU, where I learned to develop and deploy a functional website. Currently, I am applying my skillsets to this website, which I regularly update on my <a href="https://github.com/SilentCartographer" target="_blank">Github.</a> I am looking to use my abilities in a junior developer role (and if you're reading this, most likely to the one you have available!). While I am searching for a full time position, I am currently tutoring through a company called KidCodeIt.</p>

			<p>Aside from my programming abilities, I have a great passion for craft brewing, hiking, skiing and climbing. All of which I enjoy doing as often as possible.</p>

			<p> Thanks for stoping by and enjoy your stay!</p>
