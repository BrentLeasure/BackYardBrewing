						<p>Hello, my name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brentonleasure" target="_blank">Brent Leasure.</a> Welcome to my website!</p>

						<p>Recently, I graduated from RefactorU, where I learned to develop and deploy a functional web page. Currently, I am applying my skillsets to this site, which I regularly update on my <a href="https://github.com/SilentCartographer" target="_blank">Github.</a> I am currently working as a junior developer at a start up in Boulder named the Up Beet Kitchen. Our goal is to teach people how to cook for themselves and escape our unhealthy trends of instant food. Besides cooking, we're also passionate about community, and we hope to get people closer with our work. On the side I am tutoring at a company called KidCodeIt. the company is exactly as it sounds; developers teach younger kids the crazyness that is web development</p>

						<p>When I'm not coding, I'm exploring! I love hiking, climbing, biking, skiing and traveling. I hope to explore the world through out my life and see the different cultures and phenomenons that happens across the Earth. When I'm not going on adventures, I enjoy being a movie buff, reading comics or playing video games.</p>

						<p> Thanks for stoping by and enjoy your stay!</p>
